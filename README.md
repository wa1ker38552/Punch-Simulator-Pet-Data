Statistics for pet hatching in Punch Simulator

Made a script to check egg hatching statistics for FOREST 1 EGG in punch simulator. I had a feeling luck boosts did jack shit so I made a script to check by hatching eggs hundreds of times and getting the statistics for the probability of hatching each pet. The program uses pixel colors to locate and detect which pet was hatched. This script will not work on your computer. You have to edit the ratios so that they match the ones on you screen.

**Results** <br>
Original stats are 30% Uncommon, 40% Rare, 29% Mythic, 1% Legendary

1455 eggs <br>
